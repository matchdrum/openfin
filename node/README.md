| [Use a SideCar App - Basic](./how-to/use-a-sidecar-app-basic/)                   | This example shows you how you can launch a node app as an app asset and connect to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Connect To A InteropBroker - Basic](./how-to/connect-to-a-interopbroker-basic/) | This example shows you how Node can connect to a Platform's InteropBroker through the node adapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Connect-To-Workspace-For-Interop](./how-to/connect-to-workspace-for-interop)    | This example demonstrates how you can connect a node app to an interop broker running on a platform, which in this case is the WorkspacePlatformStarter example, and perform context and intent publishing and receiving.                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Setup-An-Example-Websocket-server](./how-to/setup-an-example-websocket-server/) | This doesn't use the node adapter but is an example node server that lets you have a webform that can post messages to the server for broadcasting on a websocket. This can be used by samples that need to give an example of a websocket response and we include example notification messages that tie in with our workspace platform starter example notification service. |
