# Example of InterOp API communication between a Windows Native Application and OpenFin Workspace hosted Web Application
This is a simple example that shows how to use the InterOp API to fire intents that will be picked up and processed by the OpenFin Workspace InterOp Broker.

#### *Please note that it is very important that you are running the how-to/support-context-and-intents example from the Workspace starter repo prior to running this application.*

## How to run this example

1. Ensure that you have installed the following nuget packages:  
- OpenFin.Net.Adapter (minimum 29.2.0)  
2. Build the solution without errors

3. Run it from Visual Studio.  

4. Or navigate to the folder that has the executable (typically this will be in "how-to.v2\fire-intents\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows") and run the Interop.exe.  

5. Click on "Connect to Runtime".
